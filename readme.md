# Go Bike Database Analysis
## by Youmna Khaled


## Dataset

> I will be working on analysing the dataset for ford bikes that containes data related to the trip details , that include the customer details, his type and the trip duration info. All trips that are started in Feb 2019

## Summary of Findings

> Trips are distributed over the weekdays,showing relatively less trips in staurdays and sundays.Most of the users are subscribers not members and the data gender is also skewed showing a much larger men ratio.Another skew has been shown in both the duration of the trips  and the age of the users (skewed towards the youth group).

>> The distribution of the trip duration has showed a very large set of values and due to the fact that there were outliers, transforming it to log scale has shown a clearer view of the distribution.The mean has been seen to be around 10.
> Duration of the trip is relatively less for larger age groups.Subscribers has shown smaller duration values than customers. In additon, males have , so far , showed more counts in large frequencies,this may and may not be true based on the bias of the dataset.
> The previous finding applies for both gender and user types.
> It was also seen that saturdays and sundays showed higher trip durations than other weekdays.
> It has been proven that although men have done more high duration trips, females have done larger durations for the all age groups that are less than sixty.In addition the latest plot has shown that the reason why the avg of susbribers duration length is smaller in subscribers might be that there are more subscribers in the large age group , who is already proven to do trips smaller in durations.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> Even though I have kepy my focus on the duration, age and gender/user group, what has been most important to me was the relationship between gender and trip duration.
> It has been proven that although men have done more high duration trips, females have done larger durations for the all age groups that are less than sixty.In addition the latest plot has shown that the reason why the avg of susbribers duration length is smaller in subscribers might be that there are more subscribers in the large age group , who is already proven to do trips smaller in durations.
> The most surprising feature has been the distribution of genders that may make anyone claim that men can have higher strengths in trips regarding duration, women has actually shown better strength in that.
